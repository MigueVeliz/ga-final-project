# The name of your app.
* Nyc Plays (might change it)

# What your MVP looks like.
* My app will have the folling functionalities: It will initially support: Daily Games: Take 5, Numbers, Win 4, Qucik Draw, Pick 10

- Will allow the user to create his own games:
-- The user will be able to store data for each specific game
-- The app will also "suggest" random numbers to the user for a specific game i.e.
-- Then once the user goes to a local retailer he can use the app to see all the data he stored before and play.
-- The user will be able to check previus winning numbers for a specific game & data he previously stored.

# What your reach goals are.
* Make my web app into a React Native App and publish it on the playstore
* Add a Scan Ticket functionality

# User stories that describe how your app will be used.
1- "Oh, I am tired of writing all my take 5 numbers on paper and then going to the store and look at my paper to remember my take 5 numbers"

2- "Someone needs to create an app that will allow the lotto players to store their data on their phones in a clean and nice way that they can remember."

# Wireframes!
